Both implementation were written in single .c files.
Please run
    $ make -f MakeFile

then for multi-processing, run
    $ ./pproduce N B P C

and for multi-threading, run
    $ ./tproduce N B P C

To clean up, run
    $ make -f MakeFile clean

Notes:
    Had some issues with the script "run_pc.sh" so some data in the lab report were calculated manually (c code is fine).
